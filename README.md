# Project "PicS", free stock photos.

It is made as a testing alternative to [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).
I used [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) to make it work. Nothing super complicated, just generate random photos or search for particular ones. We can choose the size and download images if needed.
